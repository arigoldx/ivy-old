This is ivy education, a teaching tool and curriculum development.

ivy was written under ruby-1.9.3-p194 which makes it kinda old but the code's
strong and the ideas sound.

One of these days when the need arises, I'll update it.  Maybe into a JavaScript
framework - switching framework's is in it's history as it was originally
written in PHP but I had been reading about Rails and MVC so I switched from my
unorganized bunch of files to the nice lil' boxes of RoR.  (of course I was
probably just caught up in the hype and didn't know of any MVC
framworks in PHP).

Originally hosted at ivy.rubyforge.org but due to problems at rubyforge, I
brought it over to github.

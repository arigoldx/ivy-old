* when editing an assigment, the grading type does not default to what has already been set in the database.

* need to generate a different view depending upon how the view is called.
  for example, if we're trying to create a new assignment_log VIA a course then we need not specify what course
  is being used.  if, however, we're trying to create a new assignment_log from the assignments listing or
  assignment_log listing then we DO need to include a course field.
  this might be worked around (elegantly) by specifying the course _before_ calling 'new'.

* provide archiving of plans in addition to deleting

* all strings are varchar(255).
  1 - does varchar(255) have significant performance improvements to varchar(100) (etc etc)
  2 - change em?

* add groupings to lesson and assignments.  should be able to:
  - add/remove to groups
  - create with grouping

** need to be able to create assignment_logs via existent lessons - for due dates and repeating assignments, etc.
   so there could be a dropdown with something like "due on lesson of <drop down>"

* ? highlight unfinished work in lesson/page

* Applications/Aquamacs Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/edit-modes/emacs-rails
directory where ror mode is defined, etc.  contact developer regarding error for html sexp matching

* should probably not show students in attendance list if they've been marked absent

* good non-ferreted searching from ryanB
http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=11819

* deep searching

ferret and acts_as ferret.  fancy indexed, searching.
both are installed but not being used yet for the Big Reason - is the technology necessary?

* ajaxy pagination:

* when editing plans, need to be able to change date

* when creating plans, need to be able to do it per grade

* run validation checks when working with lessons - you should not be
  able to make the mistake of entering data for a lesson on date X when
  you really should be entering it for date Y.  also, you should not be
  able to chronicle the same activity for the same lesson.

* add periods to lessons?

* better pagination - start on todays date and not just "next" and
 "previous but "1 .. 2 .. 3 ..".

* add 'delete' 'edit' to coursenotes & ajax

* default room for edit lesson sticks to 306.. should change with edits.

* put lesson_id in session for ease of editing coursenotes (to redirect
 to that lesson) - in fact, the routing is not so good now.. if, in
 working on a lesson, you edit a coursenote, it puts you back to that
 courses pages, not the lesson page.

* search for students by name (auto complete

* check validity on lesson creation

* provide group features on lessons

* attendance for attendance, not chronicles

* merging activities.  as organizing tool.  maybe "ewe" and "conducting"
  can also be categorized as something else.  maybe cross categorizing.

* in order to move around pages easier, a ring of recently viewed pages
  could be kept which will make returning to pages after edits better,
  and whatever else comes up.
